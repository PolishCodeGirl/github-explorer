### Overview
To create this application I used [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) which gave me an opportunity to jump strictly into the code and start to build the application.

For state management the app uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

All components are styled by [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library which allows us to style elements directly in .js files. Additionally, I used the [styled-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-kit) package (which has been created by my friend Robert Kirsz. Itâ€™s a package with my favourite `Div` component which is a helper wrapper for a component that makes it easy to position its children using flex attributes.

For making HTTP request to fetch or save data I used the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

For the testing purpose, I used the [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) which was set up by Creat React App.
